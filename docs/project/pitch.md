## Database Architecture

Our application uses Supabase as the database backend, with a well-structured PostgreSQL schema that implements Row Level Security (RLS) and follows best practices for scalability and security.

### Core Schema

#### User Management

- `profiles`: Extends Supabase auth.users with additional user information
- `organizations`: Manages company/agency workspaces
- `projects`: Organizes work within organizations
- `memberships`: Unified system for managing access to organizations and projects

#### Subscription System

- `subscription_plans`: Defines available pricing tiers (Individual and Agency plans)
- `subscriptions`: Tracks active subscriptions with Stripe integration
- `credit_pools`: Manages credit allocation for usage-based features
- `credit_allocations`: Controls credit distribution to projects
- `credit_transactions`: Logs all credit-related activities

#### API Management

- `api_services`: Defines available API services (GSC, GA4, SERP)
- `api_quota_allocations`: Controls API usage limits per user

#### User Flow

- `user_onboarding`: Tracks user onboarding progress
- `oauth_states`: Manages OAuth flow for third-party integrations

### SEO Tools Schema

#### Site Management

- `sites`: Core table for managing websites within projects
- `user_google_accounts`: Stores Google OAuth credentials
- `gsc_properties`: Manages Google Search Console properties
- `gsc_verification_methods`: Tracks GSC site verification status

#### Analytics & Metrics

- `url_metrics`: Stores technical SEO metrics from crawls
- `gsc_metrics`: Stores Google Search Console performance data
- `crawl_jobs`: Manages website crawling operations
- `gsc_sync_jobs`: Controls GSC data synchronization

#### Content & Keywords

- `keyword_clusters`: Groups related keywords for content strategy
- `content_suggestions`: Stores AI-generated content recommendations
- `url_html_snapshots`: Archives page versions for comparison

### Security Model

The database implements comprehensive Row Level Security (RLS) policies:

1. **User-Level Security**
   - Users can only access their own profile data
   - OAuth and onboarding data is strictly user-scoped

2. **Organization-Level Security**
   - Organization access is controlled through ownership and memberships
   - Organization owners have elevated privileges for management

3. **Project-Level Security**
   - Project access inherits from organization membership
   - Additional project-specific roles can be assigned

4. **Resource-Level Security**
   - All SEO tools and metrics are scoped to projects
   - API quotas and credit usage are strictly controlled

### Database Functions

Key helper functions for access control and resource management:

- `has_organization_access(organization_id)`
- `has_project_access(project_id)`
- `is_organization_owner(organization_id)`
- `get_available_credits(owner_type, owner_id)`
- `allocate_project_credits(project_id, monthly_limit)`
- `record_credit_usage(project_id, amount, description)`

### Initialization Data

The database includes seed data for:

1. **Subscription Plans**
   - Individual tiers: Basic, Pro, Business
   - Agency tiers: Starter, Pro, Enterprise
   - Each with predefined credit limits and feature sets

2. **API Services**
   - GSC: Google Search Console integration
   - GA4: Google Analytics 4 integration
   - SERP: Search Engine Results Page tracking

## Product Design Q&A

### Credit System vs. Flat Subscriptions

**Q: Is the credit-based system compatible with flat subscriptions?**

A: Yes, the credit system provides flexibility rather than limitation:

- We can create subscription plans with very high or unlimited credits
- Credits serve as a usage tracking mechanism even with unlimited plans
- The system allows for hybrid models (base credits + overage charges)
- Credits help prevent abuse in unlimited plans by setting soft limits

**Q: Why use credits instead of direct API call counting?**

A: Credits provide several advantages:

- Abstraction layer that allows different features to cost different amounts
- Easier to adjust pricing without changing subscription tiers
- Enables feature experimentation and value-based pricing
- Simplifies cross-service resource allocation (e.g., GSC API calls vs. crawls)

### Multi-tenant Architecture

**Q: Why separate Organizations and Projects?**

A: The two-level hierarchy provides important benefits:

- Agencies can manage multiple client accounts (Projects) under one Organization
- Simplified billing and resource management at the Organization level
- Granular access control and usage tracking at the Project level
- Enables white-labeling features for agency clients

### API Integration Design

**Q: Why manage API quotas separately from credits?**

A: Separate API quota management helps:

- Prevent individual users from consuming entire organization's API limits
- Comply with third-party API terms of service
- Enable different rate limits for different API services
- Provide clear visibility into API usage patterns

### Subscription Model

**Q: Why have both Individual and Agency plans?**

A: Different user types have distinct needs:

- Individual plans focus on personal/small business use
- Agency plans include collaboration and client management features
- Separate plans allow for targeted feature sets and pricing
- Enables clear upgrade paths for growing users

### Storage Strategy

**Q: Why store HTML snapshots separately?**

A: Separate HTML storage provides several benefits:

- Efficient storage of large HTML content
- Enables version comparison and change tracking
- Reduces database load for large-scale crawls
- Facilitates compliance with data retention policies

### Development Timeline

**Q: Why split the development into 4.5 weeks?**

A: The timeline is optimized for efficient delivery:

- Backend infrastructure (2.5 weeks) provides a solid foundation
- Frontend development (2 weeks) can start once core APIs are ready
- Parallel development of components reduces total time
- Allows for testing and refinement at each phase

**Q: Why use a monorepo structure with Turborepo?**

A: Monorepo provides several development advantages:

- Shared code and configurations across packages
- Simplified dependency management
- Faster builds with intelligent caching
- Easier maintenance and version control

### Technical Stack Choices

**Q: Why choose Railway.app over AWS initially?**

A: Railway.app provides several early-stage benefits:

- Faster initial setup and deployment
- Simplified infrastructure management
- Cost-effective for MVP stage
- Easy migration path to AWS when needed

**Q: Why use BullMQ for job queues?**

A: BullMQ offers important features for our use case:

- Reliable job processing with Redis backend
- Advanced queue management features
- Good monitoring and debugging tools
- Scales well with increasing load

### Crawling Infrastructure

**Q: Why use crawlee/Puppeteer instead of simpler crawlers?**

A: The combination provides important capabilities:

- Handles JavaScript-rendered content
- Better mimics real user behavior
- Provides advanced crawling patterns
- Supports custom extraction rules

### Data Architecture

**Q: Why implement RLS at the database level?**

A: Row Level Security provides several benefits:

- Enforces access control at the data layer
- Prevents accidental data leaks
- Simplifies application security logic
- Enables secure direct database access for future features

### Monitoring and Reliability

**Q: How does the system handle failures?**

A: Multiple layers of reliability are built in:

- Job retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Error tracking and alerting systems
- Fallback mechanisms for critical features
- Automated recovery procedures

### Future Scalability

**Q: How does the architecture support future marketplace features?**

A: The system is designed for extensibility:

- API-first design enables third-party integrations
- Webhook system supports external service connections
- Credit system can accommodate marketplace transactions
- Multi-tenant structure supports partner accounts
