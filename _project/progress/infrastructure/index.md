Zero One Team

### Summary

Completed the implementation of a robust Supabase library that provides type-safe interfaces and helper functions for database operations, authentication, and API integrations. Added comprehensive documentation to facilitate rapid development.

### Completed Tasks

- Organized complex functionality into focused, single-responsibility modules
- Used TypeScript's type system effectively for better developer experience
- Standardized error handling patterns across all database operations

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

- Set up Express API server for crawl queue workers
- Configure API endpoints
- Implement Supabase authentication in Express server
- Set up development environment for API testing
- Create deployment pipeline for API server

### Technical Notes

- Using kebab-case for file names and camelCase for functions
- Implemented RO-RO (Receive Object, Return Object) pattern for function parameters
- Standardized error handling with proper TypeScript types
- Organized modules to follow single responsibility principle
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for better IDE support
