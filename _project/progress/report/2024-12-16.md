## 2024-12-16 - Dependency Management Analysis: Choosing Package-Based Over Integrated Approach

Cline

### Summary

Analyzed competing approaches to monorepo dependency management and decided to maintain our current Package-Based approach (Turborepo recommended) while implementing additional safeguards against version conflicts.

### Completed Tasks

- Analyzed root package.json and workspace dependencies
- Identified shared dependencies across workspaces
- Investigated actual installed versions vs package.json declarations
- Researched competing approaches to monorepo dependency management
- Evaluated Turborepo's official recommendations
- Aligned TypeScript versions across workspaces

### Learnings

- Two main approaches exist:
  1. Package-Based (current): Dependencies managed in each workspace
  2. Integrated: All dependencies in root with shadow tracking
- Turborepo recommends Package-Based for:
  - Better clarity (dependencies where used)
  - Team autonomy (different upgrade timelines)
  - Improved caching (fewer root changes)
  - Better Docker support (easier pruning)
- Version conflicts can be managed with proper tooling and processes
- Package.json semver ranges may show differences even when actual installed versions are aligned

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

- Strengthen current Package-Based approach:
  1. Implement syncpack for version monitoring
  2. Add CI checks for major version mismatches
  3. Set up regular dependency audit schedule
  4. Document version management guidelines
- Create tooling to:
  - Monitor shared dependency versions
  - Alert on significant version gaps
  - Automate workspace-wide updates when needed

### Technical Notes

- Investigated perceived version mismatches:
  - zod: Already aligned at 3.24.1 across all workspaces
  - typescript: Aligned at 5.7.2 (updated root from 5.5.4)
- Discovered semver range inconsistencies in package.json files
- Will maintain Package-Based approach because:
  1. Better aligned with Turborepo best practices
  2. More flexible for our multi-app structure
  3. Improves caching performance
  4. Enables better Docker optimization

### Version Management Recommendations

1. Standardize Semver Ranges:
   - Use exact versions (e.g., "3.24.1" instead of "^3.23.8")
   - Or use consistent ranges (e.g., "^3.24.1" everywhere)
   - Update all package.json files to reflect actual resolved versions

2. Regular Maintenance:
   - Use `pnpm -r ls <package>` to check actual installed versions
   - Use `pnpm -r up <package>` for consistent workspace updates
   - Run version checks in CI to catch mismatches early

3. Tools Implementation:
   - Set up syncpack to enforce version consistency
   - Add pre-commit hooks for version checking
   - Document version update procedures
