## 2024-12-11 - Added Prometheus and Grafana Monitoring Infrastructure

System

### Summary
Implemented application monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization. Set up custom metrics for HTTP request duration and error tracking.

### Completed Tasks
- Integrated prom-client for Node.js metrics collection
- Set up default system metrics collection
- Implemented custom metrics:
  - HTTP request duration histogram
  - Error count tracking
- Added /metrics endpoint for Prometheus scraping
- Configured Prometheus server (port 9090)
- Set up Grafana dashboard (port 3001)

### Learnings
- Prometheus metrics should be carefully chosen to avoid overwhelming storage
- Custom metrics provide valuable insights into application-specific behaviors
- Using a separate registry allows for better metrics organization
- Histogram buckets should be tailored to expected response times

### Blockers
[None]

### Next Steps
- Create custom Grafana dashboards for business KPIs
- Set up alerting rules in Prometheus
- Add more custom metrics for business-critical operations
- Document common Prometheus queries for troubleshooting

### Technical Notes
- Prometheus scrape interval: 15s (default)
- Metrics endpoint: /metrics
- Custom metrics implemented:
  - http_request_duration_seconds (Histogram)
  - http_errors_total (Counter)
- Default Node.js metrics enabled for system monitoring

## 2024-12-11 - Initial API Setup with Supabase Integration and Queue Workers

Claude

### Summary

Set up the foundational API structure with Supabase integration and established queue workers for asynchronous processing. Implemented basic CRUD routes and health checks while following TypeScript best practices.

### Completed Tasks

- Initialized Express API server with TypeScript configuration
- Integrated Supabase client and admin connections
- Set up basic middleware (cors, helmet, logging)
- Implemented health check endpoint
- Added error handling middleware
- Configured environment variables
- Added cleanup handlers for graceful shutdown

### Learnings

- Supabase dual-client setup (admin and regular client) provides flexible access control
- Express error middleware requires 4 parameters to be recognized as error handler
- Process cleanup handlers are crucial for graceful shutdowns in production
- Helmet middleware provides essential security headers by default

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

- Implement authentication middleware
- Add request validation using zod
- Set up database migrations
- Create queue worker processors
- Add API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
- Implement rate limiting
- Add request tracing

### Technical Notes

- Using Express.js with TypeScript for type safety
- Supabase provides both admin and regular client access
- Environment variables properly typed and validated
- Following clean architecture principles with middleware separation
- Using kebab-case for files and camelCase for functions as per standards
- Implementing proper error handling and logging
