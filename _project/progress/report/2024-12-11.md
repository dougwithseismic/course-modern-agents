## 2024-12-11 - Initial API Setup with Supabase Integration and Queue Workers

Claude

### Summary

Set up the foundational API structure with Supabase integration and established queue workers for asynchronous processing. Implemented basic CRUD routes and health checks while following TypeScript best practices.

### Completed Tasks

- Initialized Express API server with TypeScript configuration
- Integrated Supabase client and admin connections
- Set up basic middleware (cors, helmet, logging)
- Implemented health check endpoint
- Added error handling middleware
- Configured environment variables
- Added cleanup handlers for graceful shutdown

### Learnings

- Supabase dual-client setup (admin and regular client) provides flexible access control
- Express error middleware requires 4 parameters to be recognized as error handler
- Process cleanup handlers are crucial for graceful shutdowns in production
- Helmet middleware provides essential security headers by default

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

- Implement authentication middleware
- Add request validation using zod
- Set up database migrations
- Create queue worker processors
- Add API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
- Implement rate limiting
- Add request tracing

### Technical Notes

- Using Express.js with TypeScript for type safety
- Supabase provides both admin and regular client access
- Environment variables properly typed and validated
- Following clean architecture principles with middleware separation
- Using kebab-case for files and camelCase for functions as per standards
- Implementing proper error handling and logging
