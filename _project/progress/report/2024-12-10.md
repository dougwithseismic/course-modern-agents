## 2024-12-09 - Implemented Supabase Library with Comprehensive Helpers

### Summary

Completed the implementation of a robust Supabase library that provides type-safe interfaces and helper functions for database operations, authentication, and API integrations. Added comprehensive documentation to facilitate rapid development.

### Completed Tasks

- Created base Supabase client configuration and setup
- Implemented type-safe modules for:
  - API Services and Usage Tracking
  - Credit Management (Pools and Transactions)
  - OAuth Integration
  - User Onboarding Flow
  - Organization and Project Management
  - User Profiles
  - Subscription Handling with Stripe Integration
- Added JSDoc documentation with examples for all modules
- Created comprehensive README with setup instructions and usage examples

### Learnings

- Structured the library to enforce type safety across all database operations
- Implemented RLS (Row Level Security) policies for secure data access
- Organized complex functionality into focused, single-responsibility modules
- Used TypeScript's type system effectively for better developer experience
- Standardized error handling patterns across all database operations

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

- Set up Express API server for crawl queue workers
- Configure API endpoints
- Implement Supabase authentication in Express server
- Set up development environment for API testing
- Create deployment pipeline for API server

### Technical Notes

- Using kebab-case for file names and camelCase for functions
- Implemented RO-RO (Receive Object, Return Object) pattern for function parameters
- Standardized error handling with proper TypeScript types
- Organized modules to follow single responsibility principle
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for better IDE support

### Summary

Set up the foundational database infrastructure using Supabase, including comprehensive schema migrations, security policies, and seed data. Also established project documentation standards with cursor rules and meta functions for consistent development practices.

### Completed Tasks

- Created base schema with core tables for user management, subscriptions, and SEO tools
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Added helper functions for access control and credit management
- Created seed data for subscription plans and API services
- Set up cursor rules for TypeScript development standards
- Added meta functions for project documentation and progress tracking

### Learnings

- Supabase RLS provides a robust security layer at the database level
- Credit-based system offers flexibility for different subscription models
- Multi-tenant architecture with Organizations/Projects supports both individual and agency use cases
- Helper functions centralize common access control patterns
- Using numbered migrations (e.g. 00001_initial.sql) allows wildcarding in supabase config for easier deployment

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

- Set up Express API server to interact with the database
- Implement authentication flows using Supabase Auth
- Create initial API endpoints for core functionality
- Add integration tests for database functions and policies

### Technical Notes

- Database uses a credit pool system for resource allocation
- Separate API quota management from credits for better control
- Organizations can have multiple projects for agency support
- All tables have proper indexing and RLS policies
- Helper functions use SECURITY DEFINER for consistent access control
