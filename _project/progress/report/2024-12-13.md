## 2024-12-13 - Implemented Extended Google OAuth Token and Scope Handling

System

### Summary

Implemented a comprehensive Google OAuth system with incremental authorization support, including scope validation, token management, and user account linking functionality. The system now handles multiple scopes and maintains persistent OAuth tokens with refresh capabilities. Added frontend integration with Google Search Console API to retrieve site properties.

### Completed Tasks

- Created utility functions for OAuth flow:
  - `createRedirectUrl` for handling OAuth redirections
  - `validateScopes` for security checks against allowed scopes
  - `handleOAuthTokens` for managing OAuth token storage
- Implemented server actions for OAuth account management:
  - `connectOAuthAccount` with incremental scope support
  - `disconnectOAuthAccount` for unlinking providers
  - Token persistence with Supabase integration
- Added frontend components for OAuth management:
  - Account settings integration
  - Scope-based feature gating
  - User feedback mechanisms
- Implemented Google Search Console integration:
  - Created type-safe API route for retrieving site properties
  - Connected frontend to GSC endpoints
  - Added proper error handling and type safety

### Learnings

- Google OAuth's incremental authorization allows for granular permission requests
- Implementing proper scope validation is crucial for security
- Token persistence requires careful handling of refresh tokens and expiration
- Server-side validation should be paired with client-side scope management
- Early pattern establishment is crucial for maintainable TypeScript code:
  - Consistent type definitions across frontend and API
  - Proper error handling patterns
  - Standardized API response structures

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

- Implement automatic token refresh mechanism
- Add comprehensive error handling for OAuth failures
- Add scope-based feature gates in the frontend
- Establish consistent patterns for:
  - API route handlers
  - Error handling
  - Type sharing between frontend and backend
  - Component composition

### Technical Notes

- Using OAuth 2.0 incremental authorization with forced consent prompts
- Implemented secure token storage in Supabase
- Added validation against predefined GOOGLE_SCOPES constant
- Created type-safe interfaces for OAuth operations
- Server actions handle token refresh and storage automatically
- Established type-safe patterns for API routes using Express RequestHandler
- Implemented proper error handling with custom error classes
