## 2024-12-13 - Implemented Extended Google OAuth Token and Scope Handling

System

### Summary

Implemented a comprehensive Google OAuth system with incremental authorization support, including scope validation, token management, and user account linking functionality. The system now handles multiple scopes and maintains persistent OAuth tokens with refresh capabilities.

### Completed Tasks

- Created utility functions for OAuth flow:
  - `createRedirectUrl` for handling OAuth redirections
  - `validateScopes` for security checks against allowed scopes
  - `handleOAuthTokens` for managing OAuth token storage
- Implemented server actions for OAuth account management:
  - `connectOAuthAccount` with incremental scope support
  - `disconnectOAuthAccount` for unlinking providers
  - Token persistence with Supabase integration
- Added frontend components for OAuth management:
  - Account settings integration
  - Scope-based feature gating
  - User feedback mechanisms

### Learnings

- Google OAuth's incremental authorization allows for granular permission requests
- Implementing proper scope validation is crucial for security
- Token persistence requires careful handling of refresh tokens and expiration
- Server-side validation should be paired with client-side scope management

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

- Implement automatic token refresh mechanism
- Add comprehensive error handling for OAuth failures
- Add scope-based feature gates in the frontend

### Technical Notes

- Using OAuth 2.0 incremental authorization with forced consent prompts
- Implemented secure token storage in Supabase
- Added validation against predefined GOOGLE_SCOPES constant
- Created type-safe interfaces for OAuth operations
- Server actions handle token refresh and storage automatically
