### Summary

Set up the foundational database infrastructure using Supabase, including comprehensive schema migrations, security policies, and seed data. Also established project documentation standards with cursor rules and meta functions for consistent development practices.

### Completed Tasks

- Created base schema with core tables for user management, subscriptions, and SEO tools
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Added helper functions for access control and credit management
- Created seed data for subscription plans and API services
- Set up cursor rules for TypeScript development standards
- Added meta functions for project documentation and progress tracking

### Learnings

- Supabase RLS provides a robust security layer at the database level
- Credit-based system offers flexibility for different subscription models
- Multi-tenant architecture with Organizations/Projects supports both individual and agency use cases
- Helper functions centralize common access control patterns
- Using numbered migrations (e.g. 00001_initial.sql) allows wildcarding in supabase config for easier deployment

### Blockers

[None]

### Next Steps

- Set up Express API server to interact with the database
- Implement authentication flows using Supabase Auth
- Create initial API endpoints for core functionality
- Add integration tests for database functions and policies

### Technical Notes

- Database uses a credit pool system for resource allocation
- Separate API quota management from credits for better control
- Organizations can have multiple projects for agency support
- All tables have proper indexing and RLS policies
- Helper functions use SECURITY DEFINER for consistent access control
